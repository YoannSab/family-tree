# Family Tree Project Instructions

This is a React project built with Vite and Chakra UI v2 for creating a beautiful, interactive family tree visualization.

## Project Guidelines:
- Use Chakra UI v2 components for consistent design
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Use professional color schemes and typography
- Handle missing data gracefully (null values for death dates, empty arrays for children/spouses)
- Include interactive features like zoom, pan, and detailed person/family cards
- Maintain clean, modular component structure
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Include proper error handling and loading states
